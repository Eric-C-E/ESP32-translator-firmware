### DISPLAY ARCH ###

Can use single SPI channel and the chip select to control.
Currently: CS connected to CS0. Connect one to CS0, one to CS1.

### ESP-IDF build system notes ###

net_task: connect to AP, maintain UDP, TCP, parse messages and push to queues, and packages outgoing messages incl. button state and audio chunks

ui_task: runs LVGL and tick handler, receives new text for disp1, disp2 via queue, triggers invalidation and flush. Can re-use Jetson code for this up to the send to screen - send to DMA bounce buffer instead, then trigger DMA SPI transfer.

audio_task: I2S mic, fill ringbuffer with PCM chunks, send chunks to net_task via queue.

io_task: monitor the 2 GPIO pins with debounce. Publish events BTN1_HIGH, BTN2_HIGH. (Buttons for Active Lang1, Active Lang2)

### Intertask Comms ###

Queues: 
TEXT_DISP1_UPDATE

TEXT_DISP2_UPDATE



### Audio Stream Out ###

Stop sending audio when button un-pressed

16 kHz PCM chunks with header:

{magic, msg_type, payload_len, seq, timestamp}

Assembler on Jetson side will take chunks into PCM stream in RAM. Logic wil run a moving window method on this stream.

On BUTTON_DOWN(btn_id)
while button not up:
stream AUDIO_CHUNK(seq, ts, pcm)
ON BUTTON_UP(btn_id) this sends a TCP message to stop receiving audio to the buffer.
